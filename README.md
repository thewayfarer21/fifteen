# Fifteen Puzzle Solver

Takes a version of the Fifteen Puzzle and solves it. Assignment for Principles of Computing (Part 2) by Rice University on Coursera.

Note that not all code is original; some comprises the template given by Rice University professors for the class.
Implementations for Phase One, Phase Two, and Phase Three methods are all original by me.
